GPT-Pro Cloud is a Docker gateway and browser desktop for running signed-in ChatGPT sessions on a machine you control. It is for individuals and small teams that need one Pro seat reachable from every device, with no client to install and no second login.

> **Disclaimer** — sharing a ChatGPT account between people may violate OpenAI's terms and policies. This repository only provides a self-hosting mechanism; whether and how you use it, and all consequences, are your own responsibility and unrelated to this repository.

Each account gets its own Chromium with a persistent profile. One gateway serves the login, the account picker, team management and the remote desktop — entirely in the browser.

Sharing one ChatGPT account with more than one person at a time is **opt-in** (Chromium DevTools / CDP) and **off by default**. Exclusive VNC for a single occupant does not open the debug port.

## Install

Runs on Docker Compose (a Linux server; Docker Desktop on macOS or Windows), roughly 1 GB of RAM per account.

This repository is public. `./scripts/up.sh` **pulls** the published GHCR images (`ghcr.io/jingxuankang/gpt-pro-cloud-gateway:latest` and `ghcr.io/jingxuankang/gpt-pro-cloud-desktop:latest`) and starts the stack — it does not `--build` on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JingxuanKang/GPT-Pro-Cloud.git
cd GPT-Pro-Cloud
cp .env.example .env
./scripts/up.sh
```

Or fetch compose only and pull the same public images:

```bash
mkdir gpt-pro-cloud && cd gpt-pro-cloud
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JingxuanKang/GPT-Pro-Cloud/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSLo .env.example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JingxuanKang/GPT-Pro-Cloud/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

If pull fails (images not published yet), build locally with `docker compose up -d --build`, or wait for the publish workflow on `main`.

Private access: a LAN or a VPN such as Tailscale (plain HTTP). Public access: a Cloudflare Tunnel after the administrator exists — [Public access](#public-access).

## Quick start

Open `http://127.0.0.1:36090` (or the LAN / VPN host) — the first visit walks you through creating the administrator account (or pre-seed it with `AUTH_PASSWORD` in `.env` for automated deployments). Then open each account card once and log in to ChatGPT inside the desk; that ChatGPT login is a one-time step you do yourself — it is not automated. The profile survives restarts.

After that, any device on the same private network opens the same URL and lands in the signed-in session. Finish the administrator on localhost or the LAN before starting a public tunnel — otherwise a stranger who opens the public URL could claim admin.

## Public access

HTTPS on the open internet is a Cloudflare Tunnel. The administrator must already exist (wizard or `AUTH_PASSWORD`) before the tunnel goes up. Opening the public URL must be the login page, not the first-visit wizard.

Set `BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1` in `.env` so the panel is not also published as plain HTTP on a public NIC, then:

```bash
# quick tunnel: no domain required
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:36090
```

Share the `https://` URL it prints. You sign in with the administrator you already created. Members use the gateway username and password from the Admin page — not ChatGPT passwords.

For a stable hostname, point a named tunnel at the same local port (that needs a domain on Cloudflare).

## Add an account

One ChatGPT account is one desktop container. The administrator adds one from the home page: **Add ChatGPT account**, give it a name, and a new card appears. Open it and log in to ChatGPT once — same as `a` / `b`.

The gateway clones the `desktop-a` image onto the compose network via the Docker Engine API (`desktop-<id>` DNS, volume `./data/<id>:/config`). Extra desks are stored in `data-panel/users.json` and their containers use `restart: unless-stopped`, so they survive a gateway restart without editing `INSTANCES` or `docker-compose.yml`.

One-time host setup: `docker-compose.yml` mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` into the gateway. After pulling this change, run `docker compose up -d` once so the mount is applied. Then adding a desk is a panel action — do not SSH in to copy compose services as the happy path.

`INSTANCES` and the `desktop-a` / `desktop-b` services stay as the built-in seats. Do not remove them; new desks are cloned from `desktop-a`.

A Cloud / CI VM that does not run the desktop image cannot prove a live Chromium. On a real Docker host (phoenix) verify: add a desk in the UI, `docker ps` shows `gpt-pro-cloud-<id>`, open the card, and complete the ChatGPT login.

## Team access

Members are managed on the **Team** page, which only the administrator sees.

| Goal | How |
| --- | --- |
| Add a member | Invite them, then assign which accounts they may open |
| Rotate a credential | Reset that member's password; their sessions are revoked |
| Remove access | Disable or delete the member; live sessions drop immediately |
| See who is using what | Machine cards show live presence per account; Team lists occupancy as information |
| Disconnect a live seat | On a live account card, **断开** revokes that member's login and drops **their** VNC or tab seat; other members on the same account keep their tab. The container stays up. They sign in again. The member stays |
| Delete an extra account | On a panel-created card, **删除** stops the container and wipes `./data/<id>` so a re-add is clean. Built-in `a` / `b` stay |

Passwords are stored as per-user salted scrypt hashes. Sign-in is rate limited per `ip|username` (10 attempts per 15 minutes), and sessions survive a restart.

## Clipboard

The clipboard is two-way between your machine and the desk on the exclusive VNC path. Text, screenshots, and ChatGPT-generated images (the in-page Copy button) all work there (gpc-clipd / xclip, plus a page-clipboard read so a second Ctrl+C does not wipe the PNG). That path does not need the debug port.

Files downloaded inside the desk Chromium stay there (`/config/gpc-downloads`). The gateway does not publish Kasm's web Downloads folder or kclient `/files`. On the exclusive VNC path, a ChatGPT download is watched to completion, pulled out, and handed to your browser's own save dialog so it lands on your computer (the in-desk copy is deleted after one save). Leftover copies are swept nightly at 03:00 local along with upload staging (a slice past that hour on the first start if the host was asleep).

Tab seats exist only when multi-user / CDP is on for that account. They cannot use the X11 clip relay — it is one clipboard for the whole desktop, not one per tab. They paste text via CDP `Input.insertText` and images (png/jpeg/webp) via a synthetic `ClipboardEvent` on `document.activeElement`. Click the composer first; if nothing is focused the UI says to click the input. They never write the shared X11 clipboard.

## Sharing and memory isolation

There are two ways to share a chat. The basic path needs no automation: click ChatGPT's own Share inside the page and copy — the link reaches your local clipboard through the clipboard relay. With **page assist** on, the top bar gains a Share button that the gateway clicks for you, handing you the link directly.

Memory isolation is what makes one account usable by several people without shared context: with page assist on, the first time a member enters an account, the gateway creates (or reopens) a ChatGPT project named after them, set to **project-only memory**, and opens that seat on `https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-<id>-<slug>/project`. Chats inside it neither read nor write the account's global memory, members don't leak context to each other, and each member's chats stay grouped in their own project.

When multi-user / CDP is **on**, the page keeps each member in their own project: other project links are hidden in the sidebar, and a click or navigation to another `/g/g-p-…` path is sent back to that member's project. The occupant cannot open another Chrome tab, window, split, or address bar (Ctrl/Cmd+T/N/L/W/Tab, Shift+T, Alt+D, F6, F12, Ctrl+Shift+I/J/C, Ctrl+U, and page `window.open`). Gateway tab seats stay — one isolated ChatGPT target per member. Copy/paste (Ctrl/Cmd+C/V) still works. This is an in-page lock (CDP inject + `Page.navigate`), not a server ACL — the same ChatGPT cookies are still shared. The conversation list may still show other people's titles.

When CDP is **off**, there is no per-member jail (one VNC desktop). If the administrator pastes a single project URL as the desk start URL, the kiosk can open there, but that is one project for whoever uses the desk.

Page assist is not a separate switch: it is part of the per-account **multi-user / debug port** toggle (off by default). It drives chatgpt.com through DevTools selectors, so it can break when OpenAI redesigns the page; with the toggle off you click Share yourself — links still reach your clipboard — and no project onboarding or per-member jail happens.

## Configuration

Everything lives in `.env` — the commented [`.env.example`](.env.example) is the reference.

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | Optional: pre-seed the administrator password; leave empty to use the first-visit wizard |
| `INSTANCES` | Built-in compose seats (`a,b`). Extra desks are added in the panel |
| `TAB_SEATS_MAX` | Concurrent chatgpt.com tab seats per account when multi-user is on (default `3`, range 1–8). Every occupant is a tab. Idle tabs close after ~45s without a presence beat |
| `BIND_ADDR` | Address the gateway publishes on; `127.0.0.1` when tunneling, LAN or VPN address on a private network |
| `PROXY_URL_A`, `PROXY_URL_B` | Default per-account proxy; Settings (per desk or Apply to all) take precedence and apply immediately |
| `PROXY_URL` | Default proxy shared by every account |

A proxy is only needed when the server cannot reach ChatGPT directly (for example, hosts in mainland China); leave it empty otherwise. The prerequisite is an `http://` / `https://` / `socks5://` endpoint reachable from the server — for a proxy client running on the host, a loopback address like `http://127.0.0.1:7890` works and is rewritten to a container-reachable one automatically.

On **Settings**, **Apply to all** writes the same address to every ChatGPT desk and pushes it live the same way as saving one row (clipd / `--proxy-server`, Chromium restarts). Addresses you have saved stay as chips so you can pick one again without retyping.

## Desktop frame rate

**Settings → 桌面画质** caps the desktop refresh rate for every account (`15 / 24 / 30 / 60`, default 30). The full-desktop stream is the heavy path: the container software-renders 1920×1080 and KasmVNC encodes it at the stock 60 fps cap, which saturates CPU and adds lag through Cloudflare. 30 fps halves the encoding load — latency improves and, counterintuitively, sharpness usually does too (the encoder's dynamic quality has budget to stay high).

The cap applies per connection, client-side: the noVNC URL carries `framerate` and a live desk accepts changes over the beat channel, so no container restart and no desk reload. Resolution is untouched.

## Concurrent tab seats

One ChatGPT account is still one desktop container and one Chromium profile (`--user-data-dir=/config/chromium`). Two members must not share one VNC mouse — and on a multi-user desk they must not share one desktop picture either. Multi-user tab seats require the admin to turn on **允许多人同时使用** for that account; until then a second person is refused.

- When multi-user (CDP) is **off**, the first occupant gets exclusive KasmVNC. A second person is refused (`409 CDP_OFF`).
- When multi-user is **on**, every occupant including the first gets their own `chatgpt.com` tab in the same Chromium — nobody is given the full desktop. The first user may attach to the existing kiosk ChatGPT target; later users get a background tab (`newWindow: false`), parked off-screen. The gateway streams **that tab only** (CDP `Page.startScreencast`) and injects pointer/keyboard with CDP `Input`. The member never sees the tab strip or another seat's target.
- **断开** on the account card is per-seat: it drops that member's tab (or VNC) without killing the other tab or the container.
- Cap: `TAB_SEATS_MAX` (default 3 tab seats; everyone is a tab when multi-user is on). An idle tab seat is closed after about 45 seconds without a presence beat.
- ChatGPT's own sidebar may still list the other member's chats. Other *projects* are hidden first; a navigation to another `/g/g-p-…/project` is bounced back. Page assist still attaches to the member's tab when they first enter and lands them on their project URL.
- `--kiosk` is off so extra tabs can be created. Extra targets are background tabs parked off-screen; members see the page viewport, not browser chrome.

A Cloud / CI VM cannot run the real desktop image. Unit tests cover seat assignment, target isolation, disconnect-one-tab, and the occupancy cap. Phoenix should confirm two members on one signed-in account each see only their tab.

## Architecture

```
browser ──▶ gateway (:36090) ──▶ desktop-a / desktop-b / extra desks
            login · picker · admin    one Chromium profile per account
                                     ├─ CDP off: exclusive KasmVNC (second occupant 409)
                                     └─ CDP on: every occupant is a CDP tab seat (page pixels only)
```

The gateway is the only published port. VNC and Chromium DevTools stay on the container network and are unreachable from outside. State lives in `./data/` (Chromium profiles) and `./data-panel/` (members, sessions, settings); both are git-ignored and never leave the host.

## Security

The panel speaks plain HTTP. Everything, including the sign-in password, travels unencrypted, so direct access is only for a LAN or a VPN. Public access is HTTPS via Cloudflare Tunnel — see [Public access](#public-access). When tunneling, set `BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1`; on a private network on a public-IP host, bind the LAN or VPN address — never `0.0.0.0` on a public NIC.

The setup wizard only appears while no administrator exists. Finish it on localhost or the LAN, or pre-seed with `AUTH_PASSWORD`, before starting the tunnel.

Rate limits and audit logs trust `CF-Connecting-IP` for requests that arrive through the tunnel.

## Development

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f gateway
```

The gateway is Node 22 with no build step. `docker/` holds the desktop image with a pinned Chromium version — bump it there, not at runtime. [Deploy.md](Deploy.md) covers rollout, rollback, health checks and log locations.
